# ABOUT
Current third-year B.S. student in the Department of Applied Mathematics & Statistics at Johns Hopkins University, with an additional major in Computer Science. At Hopkins, I work on statistical modeling and computer vision projects, advised by [Dr. Mario Micheli](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/mario-micheli) and [Dr. Anton Dahbura](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/anton-dahbura), centered on Bayesian optical flow estimation using Gaussian process regression, and robust object tracking using deep convolutional neural networks.

# PRIOR EXPERIENCE
Previously, I conducted research with Johns Hopkins Medical Institute's [Laboratory of Computational Intensive Care Medicine](https://lcicm.jhmi.edu), where I worked on projects relating to unsupervised learning for phenotype discovery in critical care patients. I also worked with [Dr. John Edison](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/john-rajadayakaran-edison) and Johns Hopkins Makerspace to develop wearable position-tracking IoT devices for sports analytics.

# PROJECTS
My [website](https://awang124.github.io) showcases several of my personal machine learning projects, including cardiac arrhythmia detection, stock price forecasting, and spam email detection.
